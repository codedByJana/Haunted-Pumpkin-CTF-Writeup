# Haunted-Pumpkin-CTF-Writeup
## My write up for the solved challenges in Haunted Pumpkin CTF🎃

### This was my first CTF I ever participate in and it was so much fun, I solved 5 Challenges of 100 pts, and 2 of 500 with a total of 1500 (+1 for the introductory Challenge) and finished at 160th place

#### The first challenge I solved was *Ghost Ship*
- I searched the image in google with "IMO Number"

it appeared in Wikipedia with a similar image that matched this one
read through its data and found the number

#### The second one I solved was *Fake News*

I again searched the Image with Google Images, the first result was a picture of an asian journalist with the true story behind it, the story provided only his first and middle name so I had to search him to find his real name

Which I found in the story written about him on HongKongWatch website

#### The previous challenge unlocked *Fake News - 2*
<img width="50%" height="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fc0e67f-f0d9-40d3-a483-eaaa23592a24" /> <br>
Which had the answer in the previous website (Tried to calculate his age by searching for his birthdate first, hence 2/5 attempts) <br>

#### The first 500pts Challenge I solved was *Blair Witch Resident*

Though this Challenge was of 500 pts, the solution is pretty straight forward
what I did was searching the image with "What is this place?" and the first result was from Giggster website, (Knew it was from the end scene thanks to Google Gemini brief)
<img width="50%" height="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e2d338-d014-4877-bd76-223a0171b54f" />
<img width="50%" height="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df31a219-5e8b-46ae-91e4-61322cee1521" />

#### The 2nd 500pts Challenge was *Ghost ship - 2*, unlocked by *Ghost Ship*, again seems hard for its points (largest category in points), but very straight forward
<img width="50%" height="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fbb705f-57b2-4c51-9391-573d2d373ab4" />
I searched for the image again with "Ship Wreck Location", the first result was the Wikipedia page for it, which had the coordinates


#### The last two was of 100 each and were consecutive, the first of two is *My identity*
<img width="50%" height="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3b08d99-bd29-451d-9c31-fd1633964986" />
My first intiuition is look at the wallet closely to find the birthdate in any Id card or passport, through the text I identfied it as a German Passport, which didn't reallly matter because pretty much any id number has your birthdate in the first 8 digits or so

#### *My Identity -2*
The next challenge was *My Identity 2*, which unlike and challenge had 1 attempt (a yes or no Q, duh)
<img width="50%" height="100%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd9ad328-55e3-418e-9feb-7ed460589629" />
to verify the passport authenticity I had to look closely at the text just below the Id number, which was {SCHWEIZER<SAMPLE<<HELVETIA<<<<}
This text indicates that it's a sample passport not a genuine one, info is from the official German
